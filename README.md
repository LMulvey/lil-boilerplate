# Vite + React + Typescript + Tailwind + ESLint a.k.a, the Lil Boilerplate
These are the things I like to use when bootstrapping a lil project.

To use, run:

```
pnpm dlx degit lmulvey/lil-boilerplate my-app
```

And then enter the directory and run the following commands:

```
cd my-app
pnpm install
```

And then to run the local:

```
pnpm run dev
```

Build your app in the `src` folder!
